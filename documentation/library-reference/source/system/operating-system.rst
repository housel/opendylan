Introduction
------------

The operating-system module is part of the System library. It provides
an interface to some features of the host machineâ€™s operating system.

This chapter describes the functions and constants that the
operating-system module contains.

Manipulating environment information
------------------------------------

The operating-system module contains a number of interfaces for
examining and specifying information about the operating system
environment of the host machine. As well as providing constants that you
can use in your code, you can examine and set the value of any
environment variable in the system.

The following constants contain machine-specific information:

- :const:`$architecture-little-endian?`
- :const:`$machine-name`
- :const:`$os-name`
- :const:`$os-variant`
- :const:`$os-version`
- :const:`$platform-name`

These constants contain information about the hardware and software
resident on the host machine. The constants let you programmatically
check the current system conditions before executing a piece of code.

The following two functions let you manipulate the values of any
environment variables in the system.

- :func:`environment-variable`
- :func:`environment-variable-setter`

The following functions access information about the user logged on to
the current machine, where available.

- :func:`login-name`
- :func:`login-group`
- :func:`owner-name`
- :func:`owner-organization`

Running Applications
--------------------

- :func:`run-application`

Manipulating application information
------------------------------------

The operating-system module contains a number of functions for
manipulating information specific to a given application, rather than
the environment as a whole. You can run or quit any application, and
interrogate the running application for application-specific
information.

- :func:`exit-application`
- :func:`register-application-exit-function`
- :func:`application-arguments`
- :func:`application-name`
- :func:`application-filename`
- :func:`tokenize-command-string`
- :func:`current-process-id`
- :func:`parent-process-id`

Working with shared libraries
-----------------------------

- :func:`load-library`

     running application, or ``#f`` if the filename cannot be
     determined.

   :example:

     The following is an example of an absolute pathname naming an
     application::

       "C:\\Program Files\\foo\\bar.exe"

   :seealso:

     - :func:`application-arguments`

   :signature: application-name => *name*

   :value name: An instance of :drm:`<byte-string>`.

   :description:

     Returns the name of the running application. This is normally the
     command name as typed on the command line and may be a non-absolute
     pathname.

   :example:

     The following is an example of a non-absolute pathname used to refer to
     the application name::

   :seealso:

     - :func:`application-arguments`
     - :func:`application-filename`
     - :func:`tokenize-command-string`

.. constant:: $architecture-little-endian?

   Constant specifying whether the processor architecture is little-endian.

   :type: <boolean>

   :description:

     This constant is a boolean value that is true if the processor
     architecture is little-endian and false if it is big-endian. (A
     processor is little-endian if the rightmost bit in a word is the
     least-significant bit.) For processors implementing the Intel x86
     architecture this value is ``#t``.

   :signature: environment-variable *name* => *value*

   :parameter name: An instance of :drm:`<byte-string>`.
   :value value: An instance of :drm:`<byte-string>`, or ``#f``.

   :description:

     Returns the value of the environment variable specified by *name*,
     or ``#f`` if there is no such environment variable.

   :seealso:

     - :func:`environment-variable-setter`

   :signature: environment-variable-setter *new-value* *name* => *new-value*

   :parameter new-value: An instance of :drm:`<byte-string>`, or ``#f``.
   :parameter name: An instance of :drm:`<byte-string>`.
   :value new-value: An instance of :drm:`<byte-string>`, or ``#f``.

   :description:

     Changes the value of the environment variable specified by *name*
     to *new-value*. If *new-value* is ``#f``, the environment variable
     is undefined. If the environment variable does not already exist,
     *environment-variable-setter* creates it.

     .. note:: Windows 95 places restrictions on the number of
       environment variables allowed, based on the total length of the
       names and values of the existing environment variables. The
       function *environment-variable-setter* only creates a new
       environment variable if it is possible within these restrictions.
       See the relevant Windows 95 documentation for more details.

     value of *status* to whatever launched the application, for example
     an MS-DOS window or Windows 95/NT shell.

     .. note:: This function is also available from the ``dylan-extensions``
        module in the ``dylan`` library and the ``common-extensions`` module
        of the ``common-dylan`` library.

   :description:

     Loads the library specified by *name* into the current process. The
     library must be a shared library.

     If the library is a library written in Dylan, then when it loaded,
     constructor functions will run which set up the various methods and other
     Dylan objects within the shared library. Top level code within the library
     will be executed.

.. function:: run-application

   Launches an application using the specified name and arguments.

   :signature: run-application *command* #key *minimize?* *activate?* *under-shell?* *inherit-console?* => *status*

   :parameter command: An instance of :drm:`<string>`.

   :parameter #key under-shell?: An instance of :drm:`<boolean>`.
   :parameter #key inherit-console?: An instance of :drm:`<boolean>`.
   :value status: An instance of :drm:`<integer>`.

   :description:

     Launches an application using the name and arguments specified in
     command. Using this function is equivalent to typing the command in
     a MS-DOS window. The return value is the exit status returned by
     the application.

     If the *minimize?* keyword is ``#t``, the commandâ€™s shell will
     appear minimized. It is ``#f`` by default.

     If the *activate?* keyword is ``#t``, the shell window becomes the
     active window. It is ``#t`` by default.

     If the *under-shell?* keyword is ``#t``, an MS-DOS shell is created
     to run the application; otherwise, the application is run directly.
     It is ``#f`` by default.

     If the *inherit-console?* keyword is ``#t``, the new application
     uses the same console window as the current application; otherwise,
     the new application is created with a separate console window. It
     is ``#t`` by default.
