Introduction

The Locators module provides Dylan programs with a portable, flexible,
and uniform facility for locating files.

The LOCATORS module
-------------------

.. class:: <locator>
   :open:
   :abstract:

   :superclasses: :drm:`<object>`

   This is the base class for all locators. This is the usual locator
   class for coercion (using :drm:`as`) or instantiation (using :drm:`make`)
   of new locators. Situations where this class is not appropriate
   are ones where there is not enough information provided to select
   the appropriate concrete class. For example, it is not appropriate
   to coerce a string representing a portion of a URL without a scheme,
   such as ``as(<locator>, "toothpaste.html")``, because this would
   likely result in the instantiation of a native locator instead of
   the desired URL locator class.

.. class:: <physical-locator>
   :open:
   :abstract:

   :superclasses: :class:`<locator>`

   A physical locator is a locator which refers to an object (such as
   a file or directory) in a physical file system. This locator class
   is useful for coercing an abstract locator into its corresponding
   physical counterpart.

.. class:: <file-system-locator>
   :open:
   :abstract:

   :superclasses: :class:`<physical-locator>`

   A file system locator is a locator that refers to either a directory
   or a file within the file system.

.. class:: <directory-locator>
   :open:
   :abstract:

   :superclasses: :class:`<physical-locator>`

   A directory locator is a locator that refers to a directory as
   distinct from a file. This is important in file systems which can
   view a directory as either a file or a directory. This locator
   class is useful for coercing a file locator into a form where it
   can be manipulated as a directory (e.g. for constructing a locator
   to a file in a directory).

.. constant:: <native-directory-locator>

   This is bound to the native directory locator type for the host
   platform. On Windows, this is typically ``<microsoft-directory-locator>``
   while on POSIX platforms, it is ``<posix-directory-locator>``.

.. class:: <file-locator>
   :open:
   :abstract:

   :superclasses: :class:`<physical-locator>`

   A file locator is a locator which refers to a file as distinct from
   a directory. This is important in file systems which can view a
   directory as either a file or a directory. This locator class is
   useful for coercing a directory locator into a form where it can be
   manipulated as a file.

.. constant:: <native-file-locator>

   This is bound to the native file locator type for the host
   platform. On Windows, this is typically ``<microsoft-file-locator>``
   while on POSIX platforms, it is ``<posix-file-locator>``.

.. class:: <locator-error>

   :superclasses: :class:`<format-string-condition>`, :drm:`<error>`


.. class:: <server-locator>
   :open:
   :abstract:

   :superclasses: :class:`<locator>`


.. generic-function:: list-locator
   :open:

   Return a sequence of locators that are children of the given
   locator.

   :signature: list-locator (locator) => (locators)

   :value locators: An instance of :drm:`<sequence>`.

   :description:

     Return a sequence of locators that are children of the given
     locator.

     Note that this should only be called on a locator for which
     :gf:`supports-list-locator?` returns true.

   :seealso:

     - :gf:`supports-list-locator?`

.. method:: list-locator
   :specializer: <file-system-directory-locator>

   Returns a sequence of locators for the files and directories within
   the directory specified by the directory locator.

   :parameter locator: An instance of :class:`<file-system-directory-locator>`.
   :value locators: An instance of :drm:`<sequence>`.

   :description:

     Returns a sequence of locators for the files and directories within
     the directory specified by the directory locator.

     Instances of :class:`<file-system-file-locator>` for files and symbolic
     links. :gf:`subdirectory-locator` will be called to create locators for
     any directories.
